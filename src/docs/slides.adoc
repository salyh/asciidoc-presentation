//but not yet certified due to TCK are not accessible by Apache yet +

Contains also modules which are not defined in JSR-353 +
-> Object mapper  +
-> JAX-RS provider  +
-> Websocket (JSR-356) integration  +
-> JSON DSL for mutating documents in a simple and comfortable manner +

== What is Johnzon? (cont.)
* Object mapper will be JSR-367 (API for JSON Binding/JSON-B) compliant once the spec is finalized
* The pasrer will also be JSR-374 (Update of JSR-353) compliant once the spec is finalized
** this is already in progress, pls. refer to https://github.com/apache/incubator-johnzon/tree/jsr374_367

* Currently incubating within the Apache Incubator
** and looking for new community members
** low entrance barrier

== What is the Apache Incubator
The Incubator project is the entry path into The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) for projects and codebases 
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. 

The Apache Incubator has two primary goals:

* Ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards
* Develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles

== What is a JSR

* JSR -> Java Specification Request
* A formal standardization process
* Community involved
* Controlled by Oracle (originally by Sun)

== What is a TCK

* TCK -> Technology Compatibility Kit
* Test suite which must be passed to get certified

== JSR-353 Basics

* Can be used standalone or within a JEE container
* Provides a streaming API as well as an "Tree Model" API
